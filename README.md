# Automated detection and detection range of primate duets: A case study of the red titi monkey (*Plecturocebus discolor*) using passive acoustic monitoring


## Introduction
This repository contains data and code related to the analyses presented in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.1173722/full">van Kuijk et al. (2023)</a>.  

## ***Scripts*** 
The main directory contains three R-scripts related to different analyses:
- **Script 1**: Contains code related to determining the temporal distrubution, source level and attenuation of duets.
- **Script 2**: Contains code related to automated detection of duets and the detection distance of duets using our PAM setup. We use an automated detection tool from the R-package *monitoR*, written by Jon Katz and Sasha Hafner and published in Katz et al. (2016), for automated detection of titi duets in audio files.
- **Script 3**: This script is a modified version of the PAMGuide script written by Nathan D. Merchant, published in Merchant et al. (2015). The primary modifications made are noted in the header of the file. Please refer to [Appendix S1](https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F2041-210X.12330&file=mee312330-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf) in the Merchant et al. (2015) paper for detailed instructions on how to use the package.


## ***Data*** Directory
The ***Data*** directory contains ## CSV files containing data used for our analyses:
### **Script1**
- **Duets_Script1.csv**: A list of all duets we extracted from the Projecto Primates database from observers that followed titi monkeys.
- **Observer_Activity_Script1.csv**: The activity data of the observers following titi monkeys. We only want to use data from times where people were actively following titi monkeys, as periods of time when people were doing other non-field work related tasks, like office work, is less likely to reliably record all titi duets.
- **Home_Range_Data_Part1_Script1.csv**: 
- **Home_Range_Data_Part2_Script1.csv**: 
- **Playback_exp.csv**:
- **Playback_obs.csv**:
### **Script 2**
- **audioFileList**: A list of four audio files that we'll use to demonstrate how we used *monitoR*'s binary point matching algorithm to detect titi duets in our audio data.
