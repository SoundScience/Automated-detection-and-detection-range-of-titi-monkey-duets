# Automated detection and detection range of primate duets: a case study of the red titi monkey (*Plecturocebus discolor*) using passice acoustic monitoring


## Introduction
This repository contains data and code related to the analyses presented in <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2023.1173722/abstract">Automated detection and detection range of primate duets: A case study of the red titi monkey (*Plecturocebus discolor*) using passive acoustic monitoring
</a>.

## ***Scripts*** Directory
The ***Scripts*** directory contains four R-scripts related to different analyses:
- **Script 1**: Contains code related to determining the temporal distrubution, source level and attenuation of duets.
- **Script 2**: Contains code related to calculating the detection radius and detection distance of duets.
- **Script 3**: Contains code using an automated detection tool from the R-package *monitoR* , written by Jon Katz and Sasha Hafner and published in Katz et al. (2016), for automated detection of titi duets in audio files.
- **Script 4**: This script is a modified version of the PAMGuide script written by Nathan Merchant, published in Merchant et al. (2015). The primary modifications made are... Please refer to [Appendix S1](https://besjournals-onlinelibrary-wiley-com.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2F2041-210X.12330&file=mee312330-sup-0001-AppendixS1.pdf) in the Merchant et al. (2015) paper for detailed instructions on how to use the package.
